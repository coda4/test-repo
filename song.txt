I wanna find out what it is
on the other side of town
I wanna grab what I can from
the fountain of the grown

Lead me from the fear
And I won't leave you here
There's a way out, there's a way out
there's a way out here, believe

I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the wide world riot and
hiding out
I'll be coming home next year
